For an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following equations based on the sequence given:
\[ (y + 2) - \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) = 4y - (y+2) \]

Simplify and solve these equations:
\[ y + 2 + \frac{1}{3} = 4y - y - 2 \]
\[ y + \frac{7}{3} = 3y - 2 \]
\[ \frac{7}{3} + 2 = 3y - y \]
\[ \frac{13}{3} = 2y \]
\[ y = \frac{13}{6} \]

Thus, the value of $y$ that satisfies the given arithmetic sequence is $\boxed{\frac{13}{6}}$.


Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Using the cosine law, we have $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ can be written as

$a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain $c = 2$.

Now, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality holds when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

Using the sine law, we have $\sin C = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 C} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{9}\right)^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9}$.

The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{4} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{9} = \boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.
